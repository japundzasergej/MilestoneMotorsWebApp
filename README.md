# Milestone Motors


Milestone Motors is a web application that follows the principles of clean architecture. It is split into an ASP.NET Core MVC frontend and an ASP.NET Core Web API backend. This project is a continuation of my previous work on the [MilestoneMotorsWeb-MVC-App](https://github.com/japundzasergej/MilestoneMotorsWeb-MVC-App) project, which was a monolithic application. The current version of Milestone Motors is designed with a separation of concerns, where the frontend handles the presentation logic, and the backend provides the necessary APIs for data management and business logic.


 


## Overview


Milestone Motors is a web application designed to simulate the management and operations of an automotive dealership. This project builds upon the foundations laid in the previous MilestoneMotorsWeb-MVC-App and incorporates additional features and enhancements to provide a more robust and user-friendly experience.
